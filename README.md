# AbyssNet

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Description

AbyssNet is a Client-Server framework based on the WebSocket protocol. The Client is written in C# and the Server in Golang. the Client and the Server are engine agnostic, meaning that you can use them with any game engine or any other application that supports C# and Golang.

> [!NOTE]
> I am not sure that AbyssNet can be used with web export. This is one of my goals, but I have not tested it yet.

## Features

- **Client-Server Communication**: AbyssNet provides a simple and efficient way to establish a connection between a client and a server.
- **Engine Agnostic**: AbyssNet can be used with any game engine or application that supports C# and Golang.
- **WebSocket Protocol**: AbyssNet uses the WebSocket protocol to enable real-time communication between the client and the server. It is RFC 6455 compliant.
- **FlatBuffers Serialization**: AbyssNet uses FlatBuffers for serialization and deserialization of messages between the client and the server. FlatBuffers is a high-performance serialization library that is well-suited for real-time applications. Official tutorial [here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_tutorial.html).

Later features:

- **Secure Connection**: AbyssNet supports secure connections using the WSS protocol (WebSocket over TLS/SSL).
